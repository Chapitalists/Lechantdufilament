This is the MinuitInterface abstraction for Jamoma-based Max patch.

To get the example working, you need a running copy of [Max](http://cycling74.com) and last version of Jamoma 0.6 [package](http://jamoma.org/download/0.6/).

- In Max, add this abstraction to your patcher and set it up as explained in the provided maxhelp
- from i-score, create a new project and add a Minuit device as explained [here](http://i-score.org/documentation/iscore-and-minuit/)
